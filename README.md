Discover Gambia is a website targeting first time travellers, ex-pats and tourists specifically to The Gambia. 
I thought this would be of value because there aren’t many websites offering knowledgeable information about the country except for the standard ‘where to stay’ sites. 

This website will have a homepage including a main image, practical information, a nav bar and footer with social media links. 

There will be 3 other pages to include: 
- About Gambia
- Things to do 
- Contact Us

All pages will be easy to navigate and will also have an anchor on the logo to get back to the home page. 

About Gambia will include: 
- Interesting facts about the Gambia with a brief decription. 
- How to get there will provide information on air and road travel.
