This website will be factual and informative and will help the user find out about different areas and activities in The Gambia. As well as to offer helpful knowledge and recommendations. 
It will showcase certain experiences, places to stay, different cuisines that will benefit the Gambia and it’s business/economy. 

Discover Gambia is a website targeting first time travellers, ex-pats and tourists specifically to The Gambia. 
I thought this would be of value because there aren’t many websites offering knowledgeable information about the country except for the standard ‘where to stay’ sites. 

This website will have a homepage including a main image, practical information, a nav bar and footer with social media links. 

**Homepage**

I wanted to create an inviting space for when the user first reaches the site, which is why i chose the intense orange sunset image with birds and boats as silhouettes. 
The Practical information is something that should be readily available as for most first-time travellers, this is the information that is most relevant to them. 
The footer is available on all pages with the links working correctly throughout the site.   

There will be 3 other pages to include: 
- About Gambia
- Things to do 
- Contact Us

All pages will be easy to navigate and have an anchor on the logo to get back to the home page. 

**About Gambia will include**: 
- 'Good to know' will include a brief decription of each fact. 
- 'How to get there' will provide information on air and road travel along with a centre image inbetween both text sections. 
- 'Reasons to Discover Gambia' - similar structure as 'good to know'. This includes relevant reasons why The Gambia is such a great place to travel to.  
- The footer is also included with links to social media pages. 

The Gambia is a very unique country, with much history, culture and traditions that have survided for centuries. That's why i thought this would be an interesting section for users. Plus the travel times from Europe really should be promoted. For many wanting 'tropical' climates, travelling to the Carribean or somewhere else half way around the world is not necessary when it takes just half the time to reach Gambia.  


**Things To Do** 
Two basic sections with the same layout - the first is reference different experiences to try like tours/excurions that include: location, duration of trip and how much in local currency (Dalasis/GMD) 
The second section at the bottom of the page references Top Cuisine in the Gambia. Again with: location, type of cuisine and if it's a bar/restaurant. 

I thought this would be relevant to users so they can have an idea of what to expect before visiting The Gambia. 
As The Gambia is a third world country, and not much external marketing is organsised by the Goverment or Tourist Board - most of those who have never travelled here before expect something completely different to what they actually discover.

**Contact Us**

This is purely for those wanting to know more about either Experiences or About Gambia in more detail. I chose for it to be an 'either/or' option and the comment section is where the user can add their question/query before submitting. 
The picture below the contact form i thought was appropriate due to it being a welcoming/inviting image that would encourage the user to get in touch.
