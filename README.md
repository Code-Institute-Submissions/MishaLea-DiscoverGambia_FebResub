# Discover Gambia

Discover Gambia has been a pleasure to create and whilst it has been extremely challenging – the premise is to create a space for users interested in finding out more about the Country in General as well as collecting some fun and interesting experiences to look forward to as a first time/novice traveller to The Gambia. 

This website will be factual and informative and will help the user find out about different areas and activities in The Gambia. As well as to offer helpful knowledge and recommendations. 
It will showcase certain experiences, places to stay, different cuisines that will benefit the Gambia and it’s business/economy. 

Discover Gambia is a website targeting first time travellers, ex-pats and tourists specifically to The Gambia. 
I thought this would be of value because there aren’t many websites offering knowledgeable information about the country except for the standard ‘where to stay’ sites. And whilst good accommodation is always key, there are so many wonderful places to visit that surprisingly are not well known to those unfamiliar to the country. 

This website will have a homepage including a main image, practical information, a nav bar and footer with social media links. The logo is anchored so the user can be directed back to the home page at any time. 

# User Stories 

•	As a user  I want; 
-	To see a clear understanding of what is useful/interesting/worth my time when I first reach the site. 
-	To see a clear, and easy-to-navigate menu option throughout the site. 
•	Helpful and knowledgeable information about The Gambia.
•	To feel intrigued and eager to learn more by scrolling and accessing different pages.
•	To enjoy the images and information accessed on the site. 

# Site Goals
•	Originally I wanted to create a 4 page website including a contact us page which would allow the user to get in touch if they wanted more information on The Gambia. However the 3 pages was still a successful feat as the main goal was to provide relevant information on the Gambia and what can be enjoyed for a first time visitor etc… 
•	I wanted the design, colours and images to provide a warm and inviting feel to the website simply to reflect the Gambia as a great country to visit/move to.  
•	Provide informative and relevant content to encourage the user to stay on the site as well as create potential interest for anyone wanting to visit the country without knowing much about the country, its history, people and experiences.  


# Strategy
The strategy was to provide an easy to use site that provided note worthy information about a country that many people who enjoy tropical holidays, don’t know much about. For example, many first time visitors have so many questions and sometimes need a few days to adjust to the polar opposite way of life. (IE. Wifi problems, difference in transport and traffic problems, where’s the amazing local food and experiences to try.  
Scope
Features to be included:
•	Responsive Design – The site works on multiple devise sizes including a min standard laptop size, 1200px, 950px and 390px max widths. 
•	Colourful and inviting images to create instant visual appeal to the user. 
•	Easy to use and understand navigation that allows for quick links back to the home page or one of the other pages. 
•	Social media links are accessed on the footer on every page. 

# Structure

•	**Homepage**
•	
*mainimagehomepage

•	I wanted to create an inviting space for when the user first reaches the site, which is why i chose the intense orange sunset image. 
•	*PracticalinfoandFooterHomepage
•	![PracticalinfoandFooterHomepage](/assets/images/PracticalinfoandFooterHomepage.jpg)
•	
•	The Practical information  I thought should be readily available as for most first-time travellers, this is the information that is most relevant and when it 
comes to poor wifi or what numbers for emergencies,

## Design
- Colours:
 - The chosen colours were: rgba orange for most headers, large txt etc.. , standard grey and ivory for backgrounds. The colours combined really complimented each other  
- For text content – I wanted two styles to compliment one another and to achieve this, I used the import module 


# Future Additions to be included: 
- As a user, in the future: it would be interesting to develop a contact form or sign up for the user to stay in touch and/or for sign up options. 
-	Weekly or monthly updates on local affairs, celebrations and possibly a gallery of the country, its amazing experiences and wonderful people. 
-	An additional section covering certain charities, local artisans and organisations could be available (with scheduled rotation) for users to either send any unwanted clothing/shoes or simply by sending in a donation.

**1200px and 950px Screen Size**
Adjusting the sturcture for each of the pages was ok except for the contact us page. For this i had to adjust the contact form display to 'table' but even with that it didn't seem to fit well. 
All other aspects of the site were not as complicated to adjust. 

**320px screen size**
This proved more difficult to arrange for all pages. Especially the contact us page. Originally i had the picture as an 'image' element but due it not fitting correctly on the smaller size i changed it to a div and added the image through css. This helped the adjustment with the smaller screen size. 
The other issue i had was with the About Gambia sections. For larger screen sizes the columns were vertical however for the smaller sceen it wasn't possible to arrange, so i tried to set up horizontally. This had its own issues because only the title was showing rather than the brief wording underneath.  

**Final comments**
After several attempts at structuring the contact us page, i decided to delete the page altogether as i already had 3 pages and felt the 4th was not laid out correctly and would jeopardise final results.
