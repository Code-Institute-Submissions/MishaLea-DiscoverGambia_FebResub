                <p>USD, GBP, EUR are all accepted. If you want to use the local curreny (GMD) for ease, you will want to bring your own currency to convert when you arrive. 
                    There are many Western Unions available to do this. 
                    Alternatively you can use your card (visa/debit) at any of the ATMs.

                <p>Wolof, Mandinka and Jolla are all spoken widely in the Gambia, as many locals descend from either three of these tribes. 
                    However due to Gambia being an ex-English colony, many Gambians are well versed in English. So you won't have a problem conversing, although we do recommend 
                learning some of the basic tongue. Not to mention it will be very weel appreciated</p>

                    Most travellers visit between November-April, a.k.a 'winter season'. However, weather in Gambia is enjoyable throughout the year. 
                    Only in August and September can it be humid, but if you like tropical storms and beautiful green surroundings, then it's perfect.

                <p>
                    The Gambia is currently undergoing major infrastructure changes and with only one main highway from Banjul, traffic can be somewhat overwhelming. 
                    We recommend if hiring a car, to make sure you avoid main roads at peak times make sure to give yourself plenty of time when getting from a to b.

                <p>
                    For many, wifi and 4G is an essential way of life. So coming to The Gambia, you need to know that wifi isn't always reliable. There are two main
                    internet providers: Africell and QCell, both of which provide good customer service, sim cards and 4G services. However do take note that wifi can be unreliable. So we do strongly advise to bring a travel 
                    dongle or head to a Africell or QCell shop where you can opt for a local sim card with 4G service.

                  There are several clinics/hospitals we can recommend if needed. However Travel insurance is probably a good idea if you have certain medical requirements. 
                  Whilst there are emergency numbers, we do suggest taking note of your nearest clinic as call outs can take a long time. 
                  Docters fees vary so make sure to have some cash saved just in case.
